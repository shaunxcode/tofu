Tofu is a smalltalk dialect that sits on top of php. It implements the grammar of Smalltalk 80 and then adds some extra syntactic sugar for things like dictionaries {key: 'value'}, arrays {1 2 3} and quasiquote `(). Rather than storing code in an image individual files are used to represent methods so you can still hack code w/ a text editor or you can utilize the web based code browsers/editors. This also means keeping a code base in git/svn etc. is still viable and gives you method-level revision history!
